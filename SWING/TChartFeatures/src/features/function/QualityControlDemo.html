        Calculating and charting the Upper and Lower limits of an
        SPC Quality Control series.
        <p>
            This example includes formulae to calculate the SPC upper and lower
            limits. The Chart displays 2 series, one with the number of "good" parts
            and another with the percent of "bad" parts. With these two Series,
            the example calculates two values: the upper and lower limits.
        </p>
        <p>
            These limits are displayed using another two series.
        </p>
        <p>
            Correctness of calculation depends very much on your particular
            country's rules.
