     As with earlier versions of TeeChart, Chart Custom Axes can be created and modified at design-time or at runtime. New for this version is Grid zoning. Grid zoning permits the pairing of Axes so that Gridlines plotted from either Axis are delimited by the zone of the partner.
This chart shows several custom-axes created at design-time and persisted into the file.
