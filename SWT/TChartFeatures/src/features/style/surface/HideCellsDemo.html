		For speed reasons Surface series draws all its cells without sorting them in Z order.  
		This fast method displays correctly unless the chart is in 3D mode with a large amount of 
		perspective ( ie: tChart1.Aspect.Perspective = 100 ) <br><br>

		The Surface HideCells property, when True, sorts all cells by Z order before drawing them.
		This improves (eliminates) display artifacts due to perspective.
		Note: Sorting time is proportionally to number of grid cells ( NumXValues by NumZValues ).
