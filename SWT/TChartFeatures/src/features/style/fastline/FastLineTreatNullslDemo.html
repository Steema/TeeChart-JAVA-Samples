  <body>
For fastline series support for null points has been redesigned. Now the series 
handles null points in three different ways:<br>
1) Do not paint null points : null points are not painted (gaps in line)<br>
2) Skip null points : null points are not painted, but the regular points are 
connected with line (no gaps)<br>
3) Ignore null points: null points are ignored.<br>
<br>
NOTE: The IgnoreNulls property has been deprecated. Use the TreatNullsStyle.IGNORE 
and TreatNullsStyle.DONOTPAINT to mimic the behaviour of IgnoreNulls.<br>
