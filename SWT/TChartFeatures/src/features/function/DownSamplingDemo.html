    <body>New property for the DownSampling function. 
        <p>The DownSampling function has a new method, MinMaxFirstLastNull, which for every
group of points plots the first, maximum, minimum and last point within it and also 
includes the first null point of the group in the calculation but without plotting it.
The DisplayedPointCount specifies how many points the DownSampling function should
paint and displays this number as a maximum number of points. Try zooming on the 
chart below to see the effect.</p>
